# hello-world
My name is Kathy Farmer.  I live in Harlan County, Kentucky.  I moved back home to take care of my Mother, who died earlier this month.  A long time ago, I minored in "Computer Information Systems."  I was pretty good at programming back then and I enjoyed it.  I love to learn, so I took a chance on learning how to code today.
